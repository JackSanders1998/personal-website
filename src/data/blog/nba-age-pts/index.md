This is dataset is exported from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/nba-players-data) and contain
biometric, biographic and basic box score features of NBA players from
1996 to 2019. It has \~10k rows.

This is a plot of age on the x-axis and points scored per game (ppg) on
the y-axis. You can see that players, on average, approximately peak at
28 years of age with 9.25 ppg.

s2017 = nba[nba$season=='2017-18',]

  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position="right") + 
  labs(subtitle="Net (+/-) of NBA players scoring more than 20 points per game", 
       y="Player Name", 
       x="Net Rating (+/-)",
       col="Avg rating ~= 4.4",

I created a sample of the data called s2017. This sample only contains
data from the 2017-18 NBA season and players who scored more than 20
points. Then, I took the average of the Plus Minus Statistics (+/-) and
plotted the players with a color code based on whether they fell below
or above this average which came out to +4.381481. You can see that
Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid, and James Harden lead the pack of players
with a high (+/-), wile Devin Booker has the lowest (+/-) by far with
nearly -10.

Plus/Minus (+/-) reflects how the team did while that player is on the
court. If a player has a +5 PM, it means his team outscored the opponent
by 5 points while he was on the court. If he has a -3, then the opposing
team outscored his team by 3 points while he was on the court.
